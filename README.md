# Find the maximum of a list of numbers
## Aim:
To write a program to find the maximum of a list of numbers.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the list of marks as input
2.	Use the sort() function or max() function or use the for loop to find the maximum mark.
3.	Return the maximum value
## Program:

i)	# To find the maximum of marks using the list method sort.
```Python
Program to mark the maximum of marks using the list method sort
Developed by: shyam kumar
RegisterNumber: 

def max_marks(marks):
    marks.sort()
    large=max(marks)
    return large

```

ii)	# To find the maximum marks using the list method max().
```Python

def max_marks(marks):
    marks.sort()
    large=max(marks)
    return large
   
```

iii) # To find the maximum marks without using builtin functions.
```Python

Program to the maximum marks without using builtin functions.

RegisterNumber: 23004557

def max_marks(list1):
   list1.sort()
   large=max(list1)
   return large

```
